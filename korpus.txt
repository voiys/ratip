This was extremly unprofessional. • no lift
Hotel Forty Two|Zagreb|3|Ante|Bosnia and Herzegovina|5.0|Everything was sparkling clean. The terrace is nice. Staff was really friendly and helpful.|The hot tub was the main reason for picking this room, but it wasn't functional entirely. The room didin't have any outlets near the bed. The fridge was empty and unplugged. Room soundproofing is close to none and light was coming through the door from the hall. Breakfast was really bellow expectations. Overall it's not worth the money.
The Loop Hotel|Zagreb|3|Ana|Macedonia|10|Room: Great, big, beautifully designed room, with everything you need for a shorter stay.

The Loop Hotel|Zagreb|3|Selma|Bosnia and Herzegovina|10|The hotel fully met our expectations. We showed up a bit early, but the hotel granted us our room never the less. The room was a bit smaller than expected, but spacious enough for two people. The heating was superb in the entire hotel, even too hot so we kept our window open most of the time. the parking during the day was a bit crowded but the hotel is in residential area and there is enough free parking space around. The location is excellent, near the main street connecting the east ad west of the city. However, would not recommend it to someone without the car. Anyway, I can wholeheartedly recommend this place and would come back should the occasion arise. The hotel bar is great!|nothing

The Loop Hotel|Zagreb|3|Welltravelledindian|India|10|Very very nice staff. Stella and Nikolina were such g8 g8 help. Very nice girls! Interiors are so nice! the bar is excellent on a cold night when u hav kids :) Laura from the bar was so nice! The staff were so cheerful that they nade us feel very welcome. ❤❤|Well only a word of advice to fellow travellers that they should know that this property is a lil away from centre which I already knew. But local taxis are very cheap in Zagreb....so make use of that. Please dont rate hotel less for their location as they make up for it in so many ways!
The Loop Hotel|Zagreb|3|Hélder|Portugal|9.6|Hotel with a modern design and nice facilities. Very spacious and clean. Great breakfast and extremely helpful receptionists. The bar was also a pleasant surprise. Not so close to the touristic points but there is a station with a tram driving towards city center within walking distance. We were guests during the Christmas advent and there was free public transportation in Zagreb during the weekends.|-
The Loop Hotel|Zagreb|3|Selma|Bosnia and Herzegovina|10|The hotel fully met our expectations. We showed up a bit early, but the hotel granted us our room never the less. The room was a bit smaller than expected, but spacious enough for two people. The heating was superb in the entire hotel, even too hot so we kept our window open most of the time. the parking during the day was a bit crowded but the hotel is in residential area and there is enough free parking space around. The location is excellent, near the main street connecting the east ad west of the city. However, would not recommend it to someone without the car. Anyway, I can wholeheartedly recommend this place and would come back should the occasion arise. The hotel bar is great!|nothing
The Loop Hotel|Zagreb|3|Luka|Croatia|10|All good and good parking.|In the room it was too hot so had to keep open window to cool it down.

The Loop Hotel|Zagreb|3|Nemanja|Serbia|9.6|Everything was really great. Staff was really helpful and room very clean. Breakfast was really fresh and delicious. Also bar in the hotel was really nice with nice stuff and various types of drinks.|Maybe during breakfast should be various choice of coffee(espresso, cappuccino, caffelatte)... Besides this everything else was great.

The Loop Hotel|Zagreb|3|Peter|Denmark|9.2|Spotless room with enormous and well equipped bathroom, TV and internet, king size bed and very quiet in spite of hotel located close to motorway. Staff, especially at counter, was helpful, efficient and very pleasant to deal with. I booked this three-star hotel mainly because of the price, but it far exceeded our expectations and should probably have at least 4 stars. We warmly recommend it - great value for money.|The breakfast is ok continental (bread, sweets, cereals, spreads, cheese and salami etc.) but no warm or prepared dishes are available. Quality ok and coffee good. Location of hotel a little outside of city centre so you need transport (taxi to centre about 4 euro, tram 50 eurocent) or own car.
The Loop Hotel|Zagreb|3|Bruno|Croatia|9.2|That was my third stay in this hotel and everything is still great...excellent coffee at the bar...|Bed is too soft for my taste...breakfast could be a little bit better...

The Loop Hotel|Zagreb|3|Joe|Hong Kong|8.3|The room was nice and the bed was comfortable. Breakfast was basic but was still good. The staff who helped us checked-in was very nice and helpful, but the staff who helped us checking out the next morning was very rude and super unfriendly as our flight was at 5pm and we had asked the lady when we checked in about drop luggages for a few hours and the lovely lady said no problem at all and they could keep them in their office. But when we checkout the next morning, the other lady at the reception said we couldn't leave our luggages there as the conference room was occupied and asked us to just leave our luggages by the hotel entrance door. After arguing a bit, the unfriendly receptionist let us put our luggages in their office. The drop luggage issue had been resolved at last but it wasn't a good experience. So I guess it all depends on who you meet at the hotel.|The hotel receptionist when we checked out in the morning. And the bathroom door handle was broken in our room. We couldn't shut the door so we had to keep the door open a bit while we used the toilet/shower. And the location is a bit far the town but this problem can be resolved by the not expensive uber ride in Zagreb (around kn25 to/from town). I had given full 4 star for everything except for its rude receptionist and its a bit far location from town.

Grateful for there being plain yogurt that was healthy, that is, without sugar; and of perfect consistency for mixing with muesli. And for providing fresh eggs, and not packaged, liquid eggs. Often in the USA hotels do not have good, supportive mattresses, and proper pillows. We were delighted to find perfect mattresses in Croatia. Also appreciate that the showers have nozzles which can be adjusted for height as well as be held in the hand.|I'm slender but tall with long arms and legs so shower/bathroom was a bit cramped for me.

Hotel Jadran|Zagreb|3|Wayne|USA|8.3|Satisfying breakfast with pleasing variety. Grateful for there being plain yogurt that was healthy, that is, without sugar; and of perfect consistency for mixing with muesli. And for providing fresh eggs, and not packaged, liquid eggs. Often in the USA hotels do not have good, supportive mattresses, and proper pillows. We were delighted to find perfect mattresses in Croatia. Also appreciate that the showers have nozzles which can be adjusted for height as well as be held in the hand.|I'm slender but tall with long arms and legs so shower/bathroom was a bit cramped for me.
Hotel Jadran|Zagreb|3|Agnes|Belgium|7.5|Great location, within minutes you're in the heart of Zagreb.

And also easy to reach any bus to Plitvice/Zadar/Split or any other town. The old town of Zagreb is just 5 stops (10-15 minutes) away by the tram adjacent to the bus station. The hotel is modern and nicely decorated. Staff was great, we got complimentary welcome drinks. Room was big, clean and facilitated with all amenities. Toilet was clean.|-

What can be advantage but it brings strange situations (you pull up curtain in the morning and someone is smoking just 2 meters from you room).

The smoke stench is everywhere and in this instance the hotel has not done enough to keep the room smoke smell free. If you are a non-smoker and coming from countries where smoking is banned in all indoor areas and public places, you will be in for a shock. Having said that, we still manage to stay in many hotels that can keep the smoke smell out of their rooms but not this hotel. We got a room in the half basement level. This was not described in the room description on the booking.com website. It is not as nice to stay in the basement.

Hotel Sliško|Zagreb|3|Ariel|Netherlands|7.5|The hotel is 5' away by walking from the main bus station (where the bus from the airport ends), that's pretty handy. The room was big enough, good air conditioning, good shower and spacey. It has a nice lounge / bar at the lobby which can come handy if you want to enjoy a drink. There is also a supermarket after a 2' walk. Overall staff was very kind. Be aware that this is not a centric location, so you'd most likely have to take the tram to go to the touristy area (5' walk + 10' ride + waiting time). They also changed my sheets without me requesting it, it is always nice to have fresh sheets, as well as seeing the hotel is very well clean and neat|I was a bit surprised that pastries (namely: croissants) were not available any more by 9 am. There was a big group of tourists right when I went for breakfast, maybe they ate everything, but really? No more, so early? Options were really limited that morning so I was very disappointed by the breakfast I had in my first morning there. Coffee is so so, better to ask for a good one at the bar if you want to enjoy something that really tastes like coffee. Noise isolation was kind of a thing, I had a really noisy couple next door and they had a real urge to go in and out of the room without forgetting to slam the door, that next to windows not isolated and noisy cars can make your night to be quite long. Restaurants can be found within a 6-10 minutes walk. Not a show stopper or anything bad but it's good you plan your meals.

Breakfast was good, staff is very friendly and give complete information about hotel itself, city, transportation, sights and many other different things you need for comfortable staying. Even though I booked budget category of the room we were given with upper category free of charge due to the fact that hotel was almost empty at that time. One more positive thing is that because of early check-out we could not stay for a breakfast, so this amount was refunded to me by hotel administration without any problems. The location is quite good, right several minutes walk from central bus station, so it was convinient for us to get to shutle-bus going to airport. Just 5 stops on a tram and you will be in the city center walking these beautiful Zagreb's streets.|Hotel's furniture is a bit old, however clean and well taken care of. The only thing which was not very pleasant is that in our room the sink was blocked in the bathroom and water could not be released properly.

Hotel Sliško|Zagreb|3|Parthiv|India|9.5|Good location. The rooms were a good size and well equipped. The bathrooms were clean and tidy. The check-in process was very smooth. We stayed here only for a night but I would recommend this place!|There was no bathroom kit. There was only a handwash dispenser near the basin and one shower gel/shampoo common dispenser in the shower area. There should be a bathroom kit with shower gels, conditioners, shampoos, dental kit, sanitary bag, shaving kit etc.
Hotel Sliško|Zagreb|3|Olga|Ukraine|8.8|I would say this hotel is absolutely great choice for staying several nights in Zagreb. Breakfast was good, staff is very friendly and give complete information about hotel itself, city, transportation, sights and many other different things you need for comfortable staying. Even though I booked budget category of the room we were given with upper category free of charge due to the fact that hotel was almost empty at that time. One more positive thing is that because of early check-out we could not stay for a breakfast, so this amount was refunded to me by hotel administration without any problems. The location is quite good, right several minutes walk from central bus station, so it was convinient for us to get to shutle-bus going to airport. Just 5 stops on a tram and you will be in the city center walking these beautiful Zagreb's streets.|Hotel's furniture is a bit old, however clean and well taken care of. The only thing which was not very pleasant is that in our room the sink was blocked in the bathroom and water could not be released properly.

Hotel Sliško|Zagreb|3|Patrick|USA|9.2|I stayed in this area in order to catch the shuttle bus from and to the Zagreb airport late at night and then, a day later, early in the morning. The main bus station is an easy 10-minute walk from the hotel (which is about 25-30 minutes from Ban Jelačić Square). The surrounding neighborhood was totally different from the Lower Town area where I stayed the week before, containing new office parks, medical facilities, car repair shops, and some rather old housing. It's interesting. There were a number of decent restaurants (Croatian, Bosnian, Lebanese, Turkish, Chinese) in the vicinity, particularly just around the corner on Radnička cesta, as well as several typical cafes and a really good craft beer bar (the Hop In). My room was fine--clean and entirely serviceable--and I enjoyed the vibe of the place. I don't know the history of the establishment (and it could just have been my imagination), but it reminded me of some of the Eastern European hotels I stayed at during the Cold War, with the heavy, dark wood fixtures/closets in the room, the restaurant with large tables filled with happy and boisterous local families, the traditional decorations, the classic tunes blaring over the sound system. I really liked it!|At first, I thought that my non-smoking room might really be a smoking room. Eventually, though, I determined that what seemed to be a slight stale cigarette smell was coming from the patio down below along the street. Croatians (like others in the Balkans) smoke like chimneys, even in the presence of infants and small children, and the only safe zones are inside when food is served. (EU taxpayers should brace themselves for the massive lung cancer treatment costs that will be coming at them down the pike.)
Hotel Sliško|Zagreb|3|Josip|Germany|9.6|It is very well located in the city. This means that public transportation is relatively near, but can also be avoided completely as some attractions are in walking distance. Car is not necessary. The property has a modern look with some old-time relics inside.|There was nothing major that was wrong with the property, the room or the staff. Just minor tidbits that can easily be ignored. Or not, depends on a person. For example, the room's bathroom has no closet of any kind so it's hard to just put whatever's in your hand on a surface to free your hard. The protective plastic on a glass door of the bath was a bit damaged, leaking water on the floor. The room was also located near the (very quiet) bar which meant occasional smoke could enter the room. The parking also isn't free. All of this is easily ignorable and might not apply to other rooms or guests.

Hotel Jägerhorn|Zagreb|3|Andrew|USA|10|Absolutely everything, this is our second time staying here when coming to Zagreb and we wouldn’t stay anywhere else.

Hotel Jägerhorn|Zagreb|3|Alegra|USA|10|The breakfast had a very nice variety, meats, cheeses, fruits, breads, as well at hot foods (eggs, sausage, I don't remember but others as well). My children were made very happy by wide variety of small packages of nutella, honey, jam, etc. Our room was very spacious and very comfortable and the shower was very good. There were coffee and tea facilities in the room. The hotel is close to everything, we walked to old town and many museums easily. We stayed at the hotel twice, on either end of our trip, and so the hotel arranged 4 taxis for us to/from the airport, and every one went off smoothly and on time. And you pay the hotel directly for the taxi and get a better rate.|-
Hotel Jägerhorn|Zagreb|3|Galeann|Malta|8.3|The location is excellent and the breakfast is top notch.|There is one huge problem with this place... the rooms, even though they are no smoking, always smell of smoke. Constantly. There is a problem with their ventilation. When this was reported to front office, the lady there wasnt very helpful. She said we can spray some air freshner... I am asthmatic and that would have made the situation worse.

Hotel Jägerhorn|Zagreb|3|Angela|United Kingdom|9.2|Location is perfect! Hotel very clean and comfortable. Breakfast selection was very good.|Some of the staff were extremely helpful - others not so much! Reception area very drab and apart from very few Christmas decorations scattered about you would never have known the season. Breakfast room dark & not very warm - however the breakfast was a good selection. Always had to request more coffee and food often ran out & more had to be requested! More bacon was requested and we were told it would take 20 minutes! Very loud music filters down from Upper town! Not sure if this is heard in all your rooms but I feel perhaps it should be mentioned in the hotel information somewhere.

Hotel Jägerhorn|Zagreb|3|Ronald|USA|10|After traveling for 30 days thru Central Europe we were extremely happy with this charming hotel. One enters thru a courtyard and on the upper level there is a lovely outdoor sitting area surrounded by folliage and a water fountain. The en suite room was equipped with a contemporary enclosed walk in shower that was much better than any other 4 star hotel we stayed at. Then, there is the staff which was by far the most courteous: without us asking, they gave us a boxed breakfast with cappuccino since we were leaving at 6:15 am .

Hotel Jägerhorn|Zagreb|3|Eric|USA|10|The hotel was very nice and clean and on a walk street close to the main restaurant areas of downtown. It also has direct stair access to the old city out the back of the hotel so the location is very good.|The parking situation was a bit difficult to figure out as it is away from the property - the property is on a walk street - but a quick phone call to the hotel resolved the confusion and the process was easy from that point.
Hotel Jägerhorn|Zagreb|3|Merry|USA|10|Helpful staff, pleasant garden terrace breakfast. Courtyard entrance with cafe. Altogether a quiet oasis in a very busy part of Zagreb.|Traffic and offsite parking were challenging. We'd requested 3 beds and only 2 were made up, but quickly remedied.

Hotel Jägerhorn|Zagreb|3|Tahoe84ves|USA|10|The photos on booking.com truly represented the rooms - beds were super comfy, the lighting was intimate, room was very quiet and they had parking! Parking was about an 8 minute walk away - just call for exact directions because it was difficult to find. Someone will come to help with your bags which is very good service. We loved the location of the Jagerhorn - just minutes from the fabulous pedestrian zone of Zagreb where lots of restaurants and shopping can be found.

Hotel Jägerhorn|Zagreb|3|Haskell|USA|9.6|Great location one block from the market and right in the middle of the shopping district. The breakfast was very good and the bed was comfy.|The rooms were a bit dark. Everything was kind of drab in color. Needs to be brightened up.
Hotel Jägerhorn|Zagreb|3|Merry|USA|10|Helpful staff, pleasant garden terrace breakfast. Courtyard entrance with cafe. Altogether a quiet oasis in a very busy part of Zagreb.|Traffic and offsite parking were challenging. We'd requested 3 beds and only 2 were made up, but quickly remedied.
Hotel Jägerhorn|Zagreb|3|Jackie|United Kingdom|8.8|Very helpful reception staff. Huge bed and good breakfast. Very quiet.|Some mould on ceiling over shower. Rather cramped bathroom.
Hotel Jägerhorn|Zagreb|3|Eric|USA|10|The hotel was very nice and clean and on a walk street close to the main restaurant areas of downtown. It also has direct stair access to the old city out the back of the hotel so the location is very good.|The parking situation was a bit difficult to figure out as it is away from the property - the property is on a walk street - but a quick phone call to the hotel resolved the confusion and the process was easy from that point.

Hotel Jägerhorn|Zagreb|3|Tahoe84ves|USA|10|The photos on booking.com truly represented the rooms - beds were super comfy, the lighting was intimate, room was very quiet and they had parking! Parking was about an 8 minute walk away - just call for exact directions because it was difficult to find. Someone will come to help with your bags which is very good service. We loved the location of the Jagerhorn - just minutes from the fabulous pedestrian zone of Zagreb where lots of restaurants and shopping can be found.

Hotel Jägerhorn|Zagreb|3|Patricia|USA|9.2|We were there for only one night and wanted to maximize our time to tour the old town. This hotel was perfect for that except your taxi needs to drop you off a block away. That was not a problem except the taxi driver did not speak English and could not tell us how to get to the hotel. However, he called the hotel and they sent someone to pick us up. The taxi ride was a whole other story. The hotel offered, and I accepted, their suggested airport shuttle, always preferring to set up a ride beforehand than take a chance with a taxi line at the airport. Our driver met us with a sign outside of baggage and it felt so nice as he carried our luggage to his car. We walked past a line of sleek, black taxis, all spotlessly clean and came up to our taxi which looked like a clown car, every inch covered in ads. It was dirty on the outside as well as inside. From the moment he started the car, he was using either hi iPad or phone. He drove with one hand mostly as the other was either dialing or holding his phone to his ear. He sped and wove in and out of traffic. But worst of all, he didn’t even known where the hotel was located. AND, a first in all my years of travel, he stopped to get gas! And left us in the hot dirty car turned off when he went in to pay! The hotel did not charge us for the ride - and used a different company for the return to the airport the next day. It might have been easier to stay on the outskirts of old town and walk or taxi back in.|The hotel was lovely when we finally got there- more than a little hot and frazzled from the taxi ride. The staff was excellent. Our taxi the next morning was at the crack of dawn due to a schedule change, and we were met at the desk with a to go bag filled with ham sandwiches and fruit and a latte to go. The hotel has a very nice patio/ bar restaurant and lovely patio. Everything we wanted to see and do was right outside the door.

The staff were also very fair, it is the only time we have been refunded money, apparently because for our final last two night stay we paid more than was needed with our online booking.|-

Hotel Rebro|Zagreb|3|Otellocska|Hungary|7.9|Viszonylag újabb szálloda, igen tágas szobákkal, kényelmes ágyakkal, ötletes bútorokkal. A reggeli bőséges, sok ülőhellyel. A parkolás közvetlen az épület mellett lehetséges. Nagyon jó ár-érték arány.|A parkolás nem egyértelmű: nem a mélygarázsba kell lemenni, hanem mellette kell felhajtani az épület tetejére. Ettől függetlenül a mélygarázsban is ki van írva az irány a szálloda fele, ami kicsit félrevezető. A reggelihez nem volt friss zöldség. Viszonylag messze van a központtól, de villamossal gyorsan megközelíthető.

The Movie Hotel|Zagreb|3|Vladimir|Serbia|7.9|The style / each room was homage to one movie actor. We were in the Jack Nicholson room. The reception was in the Movie Pub, very cool place in Zagreb. The staff. Three very kind ladies on the reception desk. The breakfast.|I have a suggestion: On the Booking.com there is a incomplete address. The real address is SAVSKA CESTA 141(TRESNJEVKA) instead of Savska 141. This costed me two hours extra of driving trying to find a hotel. There was a smell of cigarette inside the room. The Internet connection broke down this day.
The Movie Hotel|Zagreb|3|Anca|Romania|7.5|The rooms were nicely decorated with actors photographs. The staff was kind and helpful. The breakfast was OK.|The refrigerator in the room did not work. When asked for changing the room, we received the answer that all rooms have the same problem. In fact, the refrigerator spread out in the room hot air, so we unplunged it. The windows did not shut properly, luckily our room had the view to an internal yard, so it was quiet. The internet was free, but very weak in the room. It worked better in the hotel pub. Otherwise, it is a good ratio price/quality
The Movie Hotel|Zagreb|3|Ben|United Kingdom|7.1|The staff were helpful with regards to tram connections and I slept like a log.

I arrived at 11 so I had to go out sightseeing and check in in the evening which meant about 24 hours with no shower and no room after my flight.

The Movie Hotel|Zagreb|3|Mac|Germany|6.2|There’s a tram station in front of the hotel (direction city) or close (from city), tram 14 and 17, night bus 32 to and from centre 15 to 17 min. The room was clean. Shower was warm and clean. Internet connection with Wifi/WLAN was good. The rooms are decorated with movie stars. Breakfast was okay, but nothing special.|The location is quite far from the centre: 40 min walk by foot. The building is quite old. The room was small. I had to flush the toilet up to 4 times and help with the brush because the water flew down quite slowly which was a bit disgusting. There was only Croatian TV (probably DVB-T receiver). From about 6 am on there was a noise from outside, probably some ventilation system which was not very loud but disturbing my sleep. Black tea was gone from 2nd day on.

Slow wifi. They still are in "G" standard. 54Mb/s. That's too slow to even watch YT. 3. Food. The breakfasts are horrible. Overcooked sausages, Cold oversteamed eggs. Small selection of meats. Cold pancakes. Horrible coffee. 4. Underground restaurant. It's called Texas Grill. Do not even bother going there. I had the worst hamburger in a very long time. Cold, undercooked and the buns were to hard you could actually knock'em on the table. 5. Small rooms. 6. Everything falling apart.

But, if you are looking for a casual place, with a character and charm, moderate price, superb service, good BBQ dining, coasy Pub - this is the place for you. 1.) Customer orientaded service: the staff performance is superb - from the first contact untill I left the service was on the highest level (at the reception, Pub and restaurant); I would like especially to appraise charming young lady at the reception Ivana who had the atmost patience with providing all the necessary informations regarding the stay and who does all in her power to make the guest feel wellcome. 2.) Food: if you are a meet/BBQ loving person (like me) you will love the food here. Breakfast is also very good (variety of the breakfast food could be better, but the quality is very good); missing some fruit, vegetables and musli maybe :) 3.) The Movie Pub: nice pub with character with photos of Hollywood movie stars. Very coasy and pleasant place. 4.) Location: excellent location on Savska street - tram stop is in front of the Hotel (15 min to the Zagreb main square by tram) 5.) The price: modest price fully worth it. 6.) Wi-Fi: in the Pub superb (30/30 Mbps), but in the rooms not so much. Tip: book a half or full bord stay - it is absolutely worth it.|The Hotel has a good space for improvement. Please notice: the negative is minor to the big positive side :) 1.) Litlebit difficult ot find the parking if you are traveling by car 2.) Outdated rooms - need restauration (with some investments the Hotel would be easily much better ranked) 3.) Parking - not too much space (but the hotel staff will help you find a place). If you are looking for negative, you can allways find it - but, focus on the positive :)

The Movie Hotel|Zagreb|3|Tiborb|Croatia|9.2|First of all, focus on the positive! :) If you are looking for a 4*/5* hotel with Spa, don't come here. But, if you are looking for a casual place, with a character and charm, moderate price, superb service, good BBQ dining, coasy Pub - this is the place for you. 1.) Customer orientaded service: the staff performance is superb - from the first contact untill I left the service was on the highest level (at the reception, Pub and restaurant); I would like especially to appraise charming young lady at the reception Ivana who had the atmost patience with providing all the necessary informations regarding the stay and who does all in her power to make the guest feel wellcome. 2.) Food: if you are a meet/BBQ loving person (like me) you will love the food here. Breakfast is also very good (variety of the breakfast food could be better, but the quality is very good); missing some fruit, vegetables and musli maybe :) 3.) The Movie Pub: nice pub with character with photos of Hollywood movie stars. Very coasy and pleasant place. 4.) Location: excellent location on Savska street - tram stop is in front of the Hotel (15 min to the Zagreb main square by tram) 5.) The price: modest price fully worth it. 6.) Wi-Fi: in the Pub superb (30/30 Mbps), but in the rooms not so much. Tip: book a half or full bord stay - it is absolutely worth it.|The Hotel has a good space for improvement. Please notice: the negative is minor to the big positive side :) 1.) Litlebit difficult ot find the parking if you are traveling by car 2.) Outdated rooms - need restauration (with some investments the Hotel would be easily much better ranked) 3.) Parking - not too much space (but the hotel staff will help you find a place). If you are looking for negative, you can allways find it - but, focus on the positive :)

Освен това ме предупредиха, че след 7 часа сутринта не е разрешено паркирането на тротоара. Затова ми се наложи да напусна хотела около 7. Вторият голям проблем беше свързан с тишината. Около полунощ няколко човека започнаха да чукат последователно по всички врати на етажа. За радост това не продължи дълго, но към 3 часа сутринта очевидно бара към хотела затвори и около 20-30 човека останаха да се веселят до 4 часа под прозореца на стаята ми.

The Movie Hotel|Zagreb|3|Riccardo|Italy|6.2|Al check in sono stati molto gentili.|Ho scelto questa struttura perchè anche se c'erano altre strutture allo stesso prezzo, questa era un hotel e quindi l'ho preferita. In realtà però la qualità della camera si è rivelata da ostello: niente aria condizionata, stanza minuscola, colazione povera, il fondo del lavabo del bagno era bloccato. Per essere un hotel è stato molto deludente. Direi che almeno l'aria condizionata in camera possa essere installata.

Integralni Hotel & Hostel Zagreb|Zagreb|3|Chris|Belgium|8.8|Stayed for 2 nights with 2 adults. Extremely friendly personnel, comfortable beds and a very clean room. We did not have a chance to try breakfast, but at any time you could buy coffee at the reception (5 Kuna). 24h reception.|Due to its location near the train tracks and next to a very busy road, it can be a bit noisy at night. Bathroom window is a bit strangely positioned, it does have mirror-glass but I still had a slight uncomfortable feeling when taking a shower. But this place has a really good value for money!

Tram station one minute walking distance, apx 10 - 15 mins ride to the city centre, a lots of snack options available within the walking distance, nice coffee shop right accross the street. WiFi works great. If you are a solo traveller, or a small group looking for a privacy, that’s the place. I haven’t had breakfast, but I am sure it’s worth spending some extra cash.|No late snack options available (except soft drinks and coffee), although there is a 24h bakery closeby (3 min. away). HOT shower will be a 5 min. thing. Would be great to have a full size mirror in the room, but, again, it’s the matter of the preference.

Integralni Hotel & Hostel Zagreb|Zagreb|3|Miyoko|Germany|3.3|The location is not far from the tram stop and Savski Most is the tram spot where some trams goes from the city center around. There is a beverage store in the same faculty to buy drinks and some snacks and a restaurant is also an annex of it. 20€ for a single bed room with a bath is a good choice for a solo traveler even the location is far from the city center.|It's far from the city center and everything is in the reach by the trams. I found a fishy guest stayed in the room 104 and I saw someone left a pair of boots at the entrance door one night and saw the room door wide open on the next night. I thought it was a typical bating program for the CRAM, say it to be a convict for someone easily taking down by the corrupted police network groups, for claiming someone to be a Muslim who would leave the shoes at the door for the Islamic image and even the door was opened as if for the theft image. I reported it to the police by the emails as I have seen such strange sightings in other accommodations such as Hotel 7 in Skopje before. Then I found some problem with my belongings; I found half chewed gum in my porter bag when I woke up as if someone invaded my room and searched through my stuff for the potential thefts. Also, my 3 months old suitcase got one wheel damaged. Only one wheel got one side shaved down as if for the secret police search. I'm tired of such damages happening in my belonging and I contact police about the problems yet the same thing happened. At least, I stayed the full length and was not cheated the refund like at Chillout Hostel where the female clerk threatened me saying "Are you leaving? Do you still keep your luggage in my room?" while it was my private room. The clerk there cheated the refund after 2 police officer came for the chatting and she returned me only 200HRK saying "last night stay" in front of my camera I was recording for further fraud to be recorded for the further police contact. And the clerk gave me only 400HRK instead of 600HRK for the 3 nights out of 5 nights. So, any hostel in Zagreb would be cheating and stealing and damaging the solo travelers' belongings these days. Hostel Zagreb is not different from other fishy ones.
Integralni Hotel & Hostel Zagreb|Zagreb|3|Alexandra|Romania|5.4|The only things we liked were location - close to tram/bus stops and the heating. Perhaps the cost was low but knowing the actual conditions I would have payed more for smth else.|Advertised as a 3* hotel & hostel, we booked 2 private rooms with bathroom. When arrived in the room, we found a pair of socks under the table.. that was very welcoming... considering also the fact that our room was never cleaned during our stay. The facilities listed on booking were not met, according our previous 3* experience: During a 3-nights stay our room was never cleaned, we had only one towel/person (for shower, hand wash, anything..) that was never changed in 3 days. One of our rooms was not provided any shower gel and just 2 small shampoos. Sheets were a little smaller that the bed, nearly covered the whole matress. The bed was uncomfortable to sleep in. Please change the descriptions on booking.

Integralni Hotel & Hostel Zagreb|Zagreb|3|Ina|Germany|6.7|The hostel was ok but in my opinion a bit too expensive. Don't expect too much. You will have a bed and a bathroom. It is ok for staying a few nights there. Unfortunately, we had to realize that hotels, hostels and apartments in Croatia are very expensive. The breakfast was also ok. You'll get bread, fried eggs, cheese, sausages, marmelade, butter, coffee, tea, water and some juices with a lot of sugar :D The walking distance to the city is approximately 50 minutes but you'll find a tram to the city near the hostel. Also there are a lot of restaurants near the hostel.|-

Integralni Hotel & Hostel Zagreb|Zagreb|3|Fajfar|Croatia|10|The lights on the corridor. Friendliness, and the whole place is just nice, quite, very well organized. Attention to details is excellent. Tram station one minute walking distance, apx 10 - 15 mins ride to the city centre, a lots of snack options available within the walking distance, nice coffee shop right accross the street. WiFi works great. If you are a solo traveller, or a small group looking for a privacy, that’s the place. I haven’t had breakfast, but I am sure it’s worth spending some extra cash.|No late snack options available (except soft drinks and coffee), although there is a 24h bakery closeby (3 min. away). HOT shower will be a 5 min. thing. Would be great to have a full size mirror in the room, but, again, it’s the matter of the preference.

I found a fishy guest stayed in the room 104 and I saw someone left a pair of boots at the entrance door one night and saw the room door wide open on the next night. I thought it was a typical bating program for the CRAM, say it to be a convict for someone easily taking down by the corrupted police network groups, for claiming someone to be a Muslim who would leave the shoes at the door for the Islamic image and even the door was opened as if for the theft image. I reported it to the police by the emails as I have seen such strange sightings in other accommodations such as Hotel 7 in Skopje before.

The bathroom does not have the whole at a good position on the floor, so the waters remained after the shower all night and morning on the floor.

Hotel Croatia|Zagreb|3|Keith|Australia|10|Staff were brilliant, nothing was too much trouble for them.We needed to check out early morning before breakfast(which was included in price),to catch a train to Vienna and on leaving we were given a package breakfast to take with us without any request on our part. Reception lady also assisted us when we dropped cases off before returning our hire car to rental agency. Helped carry them upstairs to lobby then actually allowed us to put cases our room, even though it was only around 11am.|Nothing at all.
Hotel Croatia|Zagreb|3|Martin|United Kingdom|7.9|The location is convenient. There is a small park just 2 minutes away and downtown Zagreb can be reached easily by tram or by foot. The staff was very friendly, due to a delay in my flight schedule I had to wake the guy at 1:30 in the morning, he still offered to pour me a beer!!|The road in front of the hotel can be busy at times. If you want to sleep in, ask for a room at the back side.

The hotel is not for recommendation, especially for Serbs, Jewish and all people who are anti-fascists.|-

Hotel I|Zagreb|3|Tibor|Croatia|8.8|It is a low/medium budget hotel and provide enough features for a comfortable stay. Even though it is a outdated hotel, it has lately improved its services. The staff is professional and welcoming. The rooms are comfortable enough (outdated, but clean). Wifi is excellent. Breakfast has a variety of continental options - basic but OK; could improve. Private parking (3,5€/day). Proximity of the highway.|The hotel and rooms are outdated... but I knew that before my stay. What is a definite minus is: 1.) you need to open a hot water pipe and wait 10-15 minutes to start the hot water running... besides the waist of my time, I do not like to waist so much water. I believe that cost for water consumption in the hotel is a major point. 2.) TV - not too many channels. Please improve.

Hotel I|Zagreb|3|Daniel|Ireland|3.3|The location for us was ok, for the city in general it is very tough to get around from unless you're Uber-using.|AIRCON: Air conditioning was advertised with the booking, however they only provide it for approximately 50% of rooms. The aircon rooms were all booked, so we received no air conditioning. This meant the windows need to be open, as this hotel is very hot, which meant bug bites during the night, or overheating. This is sadly a lottery system by the hotel and is ****not*** advertised as such. Be very careful, if you are ok with high temperatures and no airconditioning, that might work for you. BREAKFAST: The breakfasts were ok on one day, lukewarm-medium warm items mostly. The juice is done by machine as a dilute. The coffee is machine coffee. STAFF: The staff were unconcerned by most requests, however one member of the staff was brilliant, the rest were almost fighting with her trying to help us with problems in the room and hotel in general. She was tipped personally for her help and attention to detail. ROOMS: The rooms are dated, lots of marks and damage across the room, not holes in the wall or anything, but every item of furniture had chipping across all sides. The bed mattresses were tough, and very low, the bed clothes are fine. There were additional pillows and heavy blankets on offer, nothing asides from that and the sheet, so you either had a thin sheet to cover or a winter wool sheet. SUMMARY: To sum up, this was not as advertised which was *extremely* unpleasant to stay in. Would recommend steering as far away from here unless you get them to assure you aircon.

Bad was comfortable and sheets were clean and new. I had to balconies and on the on of them you can hear birds singing in the early morning so having a coffee on balcony was precious.|Car washing was right below my balcony, that was not cool. Breakfast was so so and the restaurant is crowded with tables and chairs. I had a problem to fit alone in the space reserved for two (and I am not over weight, big or else). Like they had two time bigger place, shorten it (for car wash I suppose) and did not want to throw excess tables and chairs. Further, they are asking you to use trays so you have a feeling that you are in MCD or some other take, eat and go place. There is no complementary shampoo as advertised. Just a shampoo dispenser on the wall. I hate this, dispensers are for hand wash only. Employees are too familiar, one of them even complain to me because she has to work what she was told to by management???. The other one have entered my room even it was locked from inside. She excused herself as she did not know that room was occupied. These remarks are only for them to know what to improve. This is not bad hotel at all, even I would stay again but price level is not followed by service. I had a way better service and breakfast in Zagreb for less money.

I did book in advance at the price of 46 EUR/room. However they wanted to charge me in kuna in the value of 53 EUR. Luckily I did a quick math to find that out. The explanation was that the room rate increased in the meantime. I had to insist for a while until they receptionist accepted to charge the price at which I booked. Very unneccessary and unfair.
