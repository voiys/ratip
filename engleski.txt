I never sleep in smaller room for Hotel 3 star less than 8m2
Our stay at the hotel Forty two was nice...... friendly staff was polite and helpful....there is parking behind the hotel, and also two parking places in front of the hotel...... Breakfast was also great with wide choice for everyone.....rooms are clean.... I highly recommend it!
Very Friendly staff. Everything else is as i expected it to be. breakfast was good as well. Perfect for my one night lay over in Zagreb.
The best
I fell in love with the hotel even before booking it, I knew it will meet my expectations. Nice, spotlessly clean room and bathroom, decorated in details. Hard working staff and nice, more like private breakfast. If you are looking for a romantic place this is the one, here you will feel like in a 5 star hotel.
Close to my meeting place. Room has everything what I needed although it was rather small.

The room was surprisingly comfortable, bigger and cleaner than some four-stars hotels' room. Some kind of pleasing cleany smell flooded from the bathroom and from bed clothes, which was really nice. The bed was amazing, comfortable with hard but healthy mattress. There was silent, so we could relax well. The breakfast and the coffe was quite good and enough. The staff was kind, helpful and polite.

Location is not the best one, but if you travel with car - wonderful choice
Excellent hospitality and assistance given by the Receptionist and "multi-tasking girl" Maria.
It looks new, is clean and if you have the room at the last floor, you also have a large terrace. The receptionist (Maria) is very pleasant person.
Everything, very nice and pleasant staff, cousy atmosphere, spacious rooms, delicious breakfast, quiet and greenfull surrounding, easy access, would defenetly reccomend to everybody...
Exceptionally comfortable, value and class.. thank you Hotel Forty Two and Team

Balneo bath is bigger than expected! Nice and spacious balcony on the top floor room. Room is big, very nice bathroom too. Too few parking spots right in front of the building but there is a parking area with lots of space 3min away. Zagreb city center is 15min away by car.
nice and clean.
Very kind staff, comfortable rooms, immaculate cleanliness, easy to park outside, quality materials used.
Nice comfy room, with very comfortable and big bed. Everything clean and in perfect order. Hotel is 5 min driving to city center, outside of the noise and crowd. Perfect for couple of days stay.
Perfect accommodation for the price
Good value for money!
Interior Personal
Everything was sparkling clean. The terrace is nice. Staff was really friendly and helpful.
Room: Great, big, beautifully designed room, with everything you need for a shorter stay. Location: Very nice, quite neighborhood, to reach Zagreb city centre, you will need to have a car or to take the bus. Staff: Excellent, very welcoming, informative and nice. Breakfast: Very tasty, with sufficient variety of food to choose from. In summary - excellent hotel!
The hotel is great choice for stay in Zagrebe either tourist or other purpose and as I have already stayed before here it was a nice surprise to see the things are getting better. For example, the breakfast which is much better than before. The staff is also polite and the whole service is excellent.
Great WiFi (given how many hotels cheap out on this, in this day basic thing, this is really big bonus), very comfy rooms and bed, very helpful and pleasant stuff. Also, location is great - near highway, but out of city traffic jams, and don't worry - Windows are good and inside rooms is very silent despite being next to highway
Good room and breakfast
Nice hotel, excellent bar, very nice staff, safe parking place free of charge. Quiet location.
The receptionist was a great and a very helpful guy. The rooms are very big. The breakfast was delicious. Wi-Fi was very good. We will be back again.
The breakfast was excellent with many choices including fresh omelets. The staff was very pleasant and their English was excellent, as we speak no Croatian. Energy saving efforts were appreciated.
All as two weeks ago and I'm discovered that ATM machine is the hundred meters away, perfect.
Very clean and quiet place. Breakfast was excellent.
Very good location to reach any target near Zagreb. The accomodation is really sound proof: despite of it is located next to a junction, no traffic can be heard inside the rooms. Clean and spacious rooms and bathrooms.
Great location, great parking, nice and big room
Clean and modern with comfortable bed. Great and spacious parking
Though thotel is situated near a main route, leading to the highway, it is not noisy, Windows keep noise outside. Our room was top-clean, bed with an ideal matress. Breakfast was fine, and if you asked for something they brought it :)
New, clean, modern hotel. Spacey room and bathroom. Good breakfast. Excellent staff.
Price breakfast design
Nice and pleasent place, very clean, friendly staff. Nice music in the loby nice bar too. Very nice, funny and usefull details in the room and on the reception. I will come back.
Smoking allowed in the cafetaria /bar
We had an early flight and Dubravko, the young receptionist, went out of his way to make us some coffee very early on 1.1..2019, and the hotel prepared some take- away breakfasts. That was a nice touch of the hotel and Dubravko was super friendly.
Hotel with a modern design and nice facilities. Very spacious and clean. Great breakfast and extremely helpful receptionists. The bar was also a pleasant surprise. Not so close to the touristic points but there is a station with a tram driving towards city center within walking distance. We were guests during the Christmas advent and there was free public transportation in Zagreb during the weekends.
Very very nice staff. Stella and Nikolina were such g8 g8 help. Very nice girls! Interiors are so nice! the bar is excellent on a cold night when u hav kids :) Laura from the bar was so nice! The staff were so cheerful that they nade us feel very welcome. ❤❤

The hotel fully met our expectations. We showed up a bit early, but the hotel granted us our room never the less. The room was a bit smaller than expected, but spacious enough for two people. The heating was superb in the entire hotel, even too hot so we kept our window open most of the time. the parking during the day was a bit crowded but the hotel is in residential area and there is enough free parking space around. The location is excellent, near the main street connecting the east ad west of the city. However, would not recommend it to someone without the car. Anyway, I can wholeheartedly recommend this place and would come back should the occasion arise. The hotel bar is great!

fresh bread and fruit, plenty of space, a pleasant light room
We liked the staff. Food was nicely done. Big bonus was that the hotel is pet frendly.

Spotless room with enormous and well equipped bathroom, TV and internet, king size bed and very quiet in spite of hotel located close to motorway. Staff, especially at counter, was helpful, efficient and very pleasant to deal with. I booked this three-star hotel mainly because of the price, but it far exceeded our expectations and should probably have at least 4 stars. We warmly recommend it - great value for money.
That was my third stay in this hotel and everything is still great...excellent coffee at the bar...
The room was very clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful, provided even more services than we expected (calling the cab, finding shopping routes, fastest way to the city center, etc). The breakfast was very good.
All the staff were very friendly and helpful. Especially the receptionists.
Stylish place, kind staff, delicious breakfast, good parking, location near center, great stay for visiting Zagreb
The room was nice and the bed was comfortable. Breakfast was basic but was still good. The staff who helped us checked-in was very nice and helpful, but the staff who helped us checking out the next morning was very rude and super unfriendly as our flight was at 5pm and we had asked the lady when we checked in about drop luggages for a few hours and the lovely lady said no problem at all and they could keep them in their office. But when we checkout the next morning, the other lady at the reception said we couldn't leave our luggages there as the conference room was occupied and asked us to just leave our luggages by the hotel entrance door. After arguing a bit, the unfriendly receptionist let us put our luggages in their office. The drop luggage issue had been resolved at last but it wasn't a good experience. So I guess it all depends on who you meet at the hotel.
good size room , good car park , easy to find , good breakfast, tram stop nearby, 24hr desk, friendly staff
We came very late at night and left early morning. We were looking for car parking , hotel was very good. 24 hrs reception was added future..
Enough parking space, a spacious and very clean room and a versatile breakfast were assets of the Loop Hotel, as well as a very helpful staff. All receptionists with whom I interacted were fluent in at least two languages beside their mother tongue.
fresh bread and fruit, plenty of space, a pleasant light room
Staff is great! Especially blonde girl on front desk and barmen. Hotel is quite new and breakfast is great!
Beautiful hotel. Large, very clean rooms, nice breakfast, free parking, good location... Great value for money!
Nice staff, modern, comfortable rooms. I love the design of the bathroom :D
Very convenient to the tram stop. Hotel is in a neighborhood about 5 tram stops to the city center, close to the bus station. Friendly and helpful staff. Nice spa next door for massages.
Spotless room with enormous and well equipped bathroom, TV and internet, king size bed and very quiet in spite of hotel located close to motorway. Staff, especially at counter, was helpful, efficient and very pleasant to deal with. I booked this three-star hotel mainly because of the price, but it far exceeded our expectations and should probably have at least 4 stars. We warmly recommend it - great value for money.
That was my third stay in this hotel and everything is still great...excellent coffee at the bar...
The room was very clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful, provided even more services than we expected (calling the cab, finding shopping routes, fastest way to the city center, etc). The breakfast was very good.
The room was nice and the bed was comfortable. Breakfast was basic but was still good. The staff who helped us checked-in was very nice and helpful, but the staff who helped us checking out the next morning was very rude and super unfriendly as our flight was at 5pm and we had asked the lady when we checked in about drop luggages for a few hours and the lovely lady said no problem at all and they could keep them in their office. But when we checkout the next morning, the other lady at the reception said we couldn't leave our luggages there as the conference room was occupied and asked us to just leave our luggages by the hotel entrance door. After arguing a bit, the unfriendly receptionist let us put our luggages in their office. The drop luggage issue had been resolved at last but it wasn't a good experience. So I guess it all depends on who you meet at the hotel.

nice new modern hotel very nice condition with lift , large parking lot and very close to airport , breakfast was excellent very fresh and good
Great hotel that looks really modern and funky! The room was quite large and had almost everything that we could think of (except for a water kettle). The breakfast was great for the price. Overall, if you don't need to be in the city centre, this is a great hotel with a great price!
The Loop Hotel is one of the best we’ve ever been!!! It is clean, the bed is great !!! The breakfast was soooo goood!!! There is a sweet table ☺️ mmmm!!! The scent that you can feel throughout the hotel makes you even more relaxed!!! It is a modern hotel, design of the rooms is very good. The staff is great!!! There is a bar that serves the best coffee ever!!! We’ll be going back to The Loop Hotel every time we visit Zagreb !!!
Very close to the highway and lots of parking right outside, which was very handy. Nice clean rooms. Friendly and helpful staff, great breakfast with a wide range of food and drink.
Modern hotel, rooms are spacious and plenty of parking if you have a car. 15min from Airport. Stella at the Front Desk was extremely helpful.
Beautiful friendly staffs very helpful I fulfil all my needs
The room was amazing ! Everything is perfect ! Very good breakfast
- Very friendly staff; Well decorated in a modern style; Clean room and bathroom; beds are really comfortable ; nice breakfast; free parking; Tram stop is just over 5min walk and takes you to the city centre within 15-20 min.; we stay for the second time and everything was superb, we'll visit it again.

The spacious room.
The hotel had their own, free parking. The staff was very welcoming, helpful from the start. The room and bathroom were nice and clean. The bed was comfortable. Breakfast was very good and refilled even at close-to-finishing hours. Hotel provided a money exchange service at good rate. The hotel was also close to gas stations, which was a plus for us.
From the facility to staff itself this hotel was on point. Amazing service, friendly and helpful staff to a remarkably clean hotel. Room was beyond comfortable and clean. One of my favorite hotels I've been in so far and I will be back! You will not regret staying here.
Great place to stay, we only stayed there for one night and it was better than we thought it would be. Rooms are great and breakfast was really good. 10 minutes from the centre of Zagreb with the car so it was nice and quiet at night. I would stay here again!
The room was amazing ! Everything is perfect ! Very good breakfast
Beautiful, cosy, modern design little hotel. Everything seems new. Rooms are spacious, smell nice and are very clean with good soundproofing. The staff is super helpful and friendly. Breakfast was delicious. I wish I could stay stay longer!
The staff were very helpful and welcoming. Check in and out was extremely easy. Rooms were basic but super clean and quite and good value for money. The breakfast was also great, with a good combination of food.
Breakfast was nice - full of options. Room was spacious.
The hotel was great in every respect, the staff were friendly but the location is disappointing. There are tram stops near the hotel but I would have preferred to have stayed nearer to the city centre.

A comfortable room, with good A/C, free parking and fine breakfast. Despite being close to a busy street, the room was quiet - sound insulation seems to be good.

A great hotel with personality for a really good price Very comfortable bed Easy access to the city center with the tram
Great staff and very professional. Nice neat rooms, spacious with good wifi and all facilities. Simple, good breakfast included.
We were positive surprised, cause we’ve expected a 3*hotel and what we’ve met was much much much more -clean, fresh decorated, “tidy” and with private-safe parking lot. The personal is very polite and helpful, the breakfast very quality and the wifi TOP!!!! Moreover, it’s pet-friendly and what we’ve paid as extra for our dog accommodation was the minimum that we’ve till now paid at other hotels. Also, it’s important for business trips, was that the rooms have IP telephones.. that is not often in hotels.
Great location, clean rooms, nice breakfast, secured parking!
Comfortable beds, clean rooms, easy to find, free parking, it was my second stay...

A modern hotel with fresh and stylish decorations inside. Room was clean with a nice furniture but could be a little more spacious, especially for two persons. We liked the breakfast, which was pretty good for a small hotel.

Friendly staff, great breakfast, modern and quiet rooms. Good location.
Position. Polite staff. Minimalism style. Good food.
Suddenly a wonderful hotel. With excellent value for money.
Visited few times already and will come back again. Staff is very friendly. Accommodation and restaurant very clean. Breakfast is tasteful and variety good. Found all and more what is expected from 3 star hotel.
Nice and clean design, warm staff, convenient location, comfortable. It is pet friendly and has private parking. It has also a nice bar on the ground flor.
I always stay at this hotel when I am in Zagreb. Every time I am fully satisfied with everything. Location of this hotel is great no matter if you are traveling by car or without it as tram stop is really close...
Very clean hotel, nicely decorated. Young and helpful staff. Breakfast was very good. In general it is 4 star hotel hidden under 3 star!
Good location with parking. Nice room with comfirtable bathroom.
Very nice little place, friendly staff, quiet, spacious room. Highly recommended!
Mileta and her two male colleagues at the front desk were very helpful.
The bed was good, front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. Location is very central - everything is a short walk away and tram stop is nearby.
The staffs are friendly, helpful and very attentive. The location of the hotel is very good close to the main attractions by walking only 5 mins. The rooms are clean and modern. It is a perfect stay for my group. Thank you.
Good hotel with convenient location. Good breakfast
Personnel (professional, attentive, kind) and location (heart of the city). Breakfast was fresh, continental and tasty.

super clean. friendly stuff. cute and cosy hotel
The hotel is just 5-10 minutes away from the city centre. Great location. Breakfast is just OK but rather basic and limited choice and variety.
Great breakfast. Close to the old town, in walking distance. The hotel has a parking lot inside for free, which actually was a part of its garden. The garden just looked like my hometown decades ago, so I took some pictures there. Car can park in the yard and luggage can be kept at the hotel after checking-out. Expensive but worth its price.
The bed was comfy. Was only blocks away from old town. Very convenient location.
Great value for money. Very welcoming staff. Good (not the best) but nice breakfast! Great location with parking. Computer in lobby!
Excellent position. Walking distance from everything. Room size ok. Good breakfast

Satisfying breakfast with pleasing variety. Grateful for there being plain yogurt that was healthy, that is, without sugar; and of perfect consistency for mixing with muesli. And for providing fresh eggs, and not packaged, liquid eggs. Often in the USA hotels do not have good, supportive mattresses, and proper pillows. We were delighted to find perfect mattresses in Croatia. Also appreciate that the showers have nozzles which can be adjusted for height as well as be held in the hand.
Great location, within minutes you're in the heart of Zagreb. The staff at the reception is very helpful, efficient and VERY friendly !

Breakfast was good
Wonderful team , very nice
The breakfast was very extensive and the people working there were always friendly. Possible to travel there by car, because there is a parking lot right behind the hotel. Very close to the old city of Zagreb. You can go by foot for sightseeing. Easy to reach by puplic transport from the airport and the railway station. Wifi worked fine.
One of the staff members was very helpful. She provided us with excellent restaurant recommendations and what beers we absolutely must try, an important fact when my father and I are traveling together. The room was clean, it was just small but that is typical in Europe. The breakfast was great. Not a ton of variety but had what you needed to fuel you for the day ahead. It is close to the main area. I definitely recommend this hotel.
The room was clean and the beds comfortable. There was also room for 3 suitcases, without feeling like you are about to trip over something, which is not always the case in a triple room. We had an early evening flight, so the hotel gave us a late checkout which was very much appreciated. The location is good, only a 5-10 min walk to the main square.
Great location A very comfortable bed
The location of the hotel is great, just minutes away from the main square and cathedral
Bed was extra comfortable, room was quiet, without noise from nearby street, we could leave our luggage at hotel all day after check out
Clean bed, towels and shower. Pretty much that is all I expect from a hotel and they have it

The hotel has a great location, at walking distance from the main attractions of the city. Our room was big and luminous, with a cozy bathroom. Everything was very clean and in good order. The staff is very friendly, helpful and they welcomed us with a smile. The breakfast was very good, with lots of dishes to choose from. I especially loved the tiramisu and the coffee!
The location is great, just a short walk to the cathedral and other sites in the old town. Having parking on site is a great advantage in a city. The breakfast is good for a hotel in this price bracket. The staff were pleasant and helpful.
The bed were comfortable and the triple room was very spacious for 3 women
The staff, especially Melita and Sonja at the reception, were very helpful and welcoming.
Location and staff
The staffs are very help in response to my inquiries before our arrival.
The hotel was clean and comfortable, and the staff friendly. The location was a little bit (maybe a 10 minute walk) from the centre of Zagreb. It's a tram ride rather than a walk from the main station, but only about 5 stops on the tram (line 4, my ticket cost only HRK 4 - about 45p).
Close to the city center with a lot of bars and restaurants. Public parcking garage near the property.
The staff was was really nice and helpfull. The location of the hotel is quite close to the center. you can reach the cathdral, mainsquare and what ever you want to see in a really a few minutes by foot. There are a lot of restaurants, pubs and bars all around.
Good choice for travelers with not extremely high demands : ordinary breakfast (no hot dishes), central location, public transport, supermarket on the corner. Hotel is quite clean, rooms are big and comfortable. Very welcomed staff. Zerozero pizza on the next street is highly recommended.

We got our wake up call 30 minutes late and we got as an explanation from the front desk attendant is that he was busy.... at 5:30 am !!!!
Near the main tour course, and breakfast
the rooms were bright and cozy
The location is very good, the staff is friendly and nice.
Excellent, well positioned....a great choice especially to see the old (upper) city)
Easy to find and the location is exellent. Private parking slot.

Good location, provided parking, decent breakfast, good coffee and a nice staff.
Super friendly helpful stuff, short walk to the center, clean and pleasant stay overall
Beds were super comfortable. Staff were super friendly and helpful.
The hotel's location near the train station met our needs for a one night stay to connect with a train. If you are spending a few days something nearer the center would be better. The breakfast was excellent and the staff helpful.
Really nice place to stay,close to the center.Receptionist lady was great.
Great staff, very clean, quiet neighborhood, free parking, great breakfast
everything
Very nice stuff! I was leaving early morning and still they made me breakfast to go. Rooms are small but nice. They also have under the bed lightning, I’ve never seen something like that before. I was traveling with my pet and there were no problems about that.
Not everyone speaks good English.
Friendly staff, fine breakfast, clean rooms. Close to train station, worth every penny.
Room was spacious with comfortable bed, breakfast was excellent, towels were changed daily, wi-fi was ok. Hotel is in peaceful neighborhood, and had its own private parking. There is a modern tv with many domestic and foreign tv channels. Room heating was ok.
The helpfullnes of staff was incredible, I met 3 different people, and they were all exceptionally nice. I stayed for one night only, though.
The receptionist is very helpful specially about ordering food. It saved my time instead of me going out, sorry i forgot the lady name in the reception but she was very helpful.
Clean and very friendly personal. Breakfast is good all what you want.
Like most hotels, there was no shaving mirror. Those with mustaches and beards and ladies that want a closeup mirror for make-up, need a proper, lighted mirror for 'close-up' work.
Everything was good....maybe renovation need it in next few years...but all was normal and good...i recommend this Hotel when you stay in Zagreb.
The room was smell very bad and it was quite small, not 34m2 as we booked
Clean and quiet hotel. Friendly staff. Great breakfast.

The ugly coffe.
Nice amd warm staff, clean and well maintained hotel, nothing too luxurious. Friendly atmosphere. Although in a grey neighbourhood, youre in the centre in 15mins. Tram is near also, free parking lot. Bed, bathroom and wifi good.
Warm, Clean, friendly person. Very close to a bus station where I can take Airport shuttle bus in early morning, but not need go to main bus station. A very good restaurant near the hotel, you can ask the reception how to go there. The food of restaurant is fabulous.
There was someone smoking in the room before me.
Last moment booking and all was very good. From hotel to center about 5€ very good.
It would be good to have a ramp to pull our luggages from the parking to the reception rather than carrying.

Staff were exceptionally helpful..and the city is amazingly beautiful. Staff was kind enough to to tell the history of the naming of the hotel. I find the old fashioned deadbolt locks much more comforting than the new touch cards. The Orient Express provides the tumbling of the lock.. very nice
The ugly coffe.
Bigger room than expected
It is further from the train station than advertised, about 800 meter s
Very comfortable. Safe location!
Clean and comfortable
The rooms were very nice, clean and comfortable, and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The Hotel is well connected by tram, and walking distance (about 15 minutes walk) from the old town. Great place to stay. And they have a good spread for breakfast every morning.

The location was great from the train and bus stations, but quite a way from the centre. It was a little hard to find, with a long road entrance through what looks like housing commission flats, but the hotel itself, and the staff, and breakfast were excellent
The staff at this hotel are very friendly and helpful. I loved the modern bathroom and found the bed very comfortable.
It was a good location and the room were a good size.
Nice, spacious room, quite good breakfast and good location, ten minutes walk from the city centre.
Our room had a separated little bedroom with a single bed, and another with a double bed, ideal for families with teen child :) and enough if the second child is 0-5 years old. We liked the breakfast too.
Service very good but my room was in the basement floor and it's molded ;-(
Quiet, yet central location. Secure private parking. Good breakfast. Big, comfortable rooms. Grat value at the price we payed.
The room was large with a very comfortable bed. The staff are friendly and very helpful, the breakfast is enjoyable catering for most tastes.
The room was spotless and the bed comfortable and spacious. The shower was great too. I loved it all and would highly recommended it. I was off to get a train early and it was about a 20 minute walk there which was ideal.

Breakfast was amazing, with real scrambled eggs and veggies and cheese and meat and ajvar, covering all needs. Made me really happy 😂 the room and bathroom were really clean. Didn't stay only 1 night because I was in transition. They stored our bags until later on the day when we had the bus. They also have checkout at 12pm, which is great if one is in no rush to leave.
Close to the central bus station and railway station Very convenient for those who need to catch early bus or train
Cosy room, well structured, very clean. Very comfortable beds. Good location, near public transport. Good breakfast.

Triple room is very spacious, it is practically two room with door between. Room very clean, polite receptionists, breakfast was delicious and diverse. good location, right next to the main street. They let us keep car at the parking spot a few hours longer after checking out and before checking in.
The best bed ever! And so quiet, great for a rest.

value for invested - cozy, close to city center, good breakfast, clean room, cozy outside terrace, kind and friendly reception personnel - overlooking the outdoor locomotive museum - hidden behind trees and although near main avenue of city it's so quiet the birds wake you in the morning - Sheldon Cooper would love this place : )
Great little hotel. Was super clean, staff really accommodating and friendly. This would compare to a 4 star hotel in most other cities. It was actually one of the best hotels we stayed in during the trip. The area around the hotel and the exterior as your approach the drive way does not look that appealing but don’t be concerned, it’s super nice!! Yes the main city is on the other side of the station but this worked well for us so we weren’t stuck in traffic and can walk away from the hustle and bustle. We would highly recommend this hotel!!
Close to train Station Could leave luggage Helpful friendly staff
bathroom too small
Breakfast was exceptional Friendly staff. Had onsite parking
spacey room, very good breakfast
Everything was wonderfull!

When I searched for a hotel in Zagreb, Croatia, I specifically focused the search to include a free airport shuttle. When we arrived and asked about the shuttle, the hotel did not offer one. However, there was a hotel vehicle parked outside the facility. When we asked about that, they did not offer us a ride. They did offer to call us a taxi. Very disappointing and we had to pay one more day for our rental car.
I had a perfect stay at the hotel, rooms were very comfortable, great breakfast and coffee. Hotel location is perfect, walking distance to city center and train station. Customer service was wonderful, very friendly and professional staff :)) I will definitely come back.
Rooms were comfortable . Walking distance to city center and train station. Customer service was wonderful; friendly and professional staff :)

Everything was nice. Room are clean and furniture is new. Hotel is near the center. Breakfast was perfect.

Hidden location, but actually quite central if you don't mind walking 5-10 minutes.

I like this hotel!
Nice room, handy for the station. Good breakfast (although Croatian sausages must be a taste I have yet to acquire).
Took a single room, big enough, very clean and smelling nice. All very comfortable. Nice shower. Excellent wifi, good for heaviest business use. Hotel has own parking, free. Excellent breakfast. Very pleasant and helpful staff.
Breakfast is really good for 3 star hotel. Staff is so kind and helpful. Price and performance balance is better than I expected. Hotel is cleaner than most of the hotels have 5 stars.
Everything was great. Stuff was very pleasant and very friendly. Breakfast also very nice. Room was enough big for 1 bed room. Very silent neighborhood.
Just in the City Center of Zagreb, the Orient Express Hotel is one of the best choices for a vacation or for business... With a staff very kind and collaborative, with comfortable and silence rooms, with a good and abundant breackfast it's greatly recommended! Beside this there is also a great value for money! I have been here several times and... I will return!
Everything was as described on booking, very clean, nice ambient, very polite stuff, nice continental breakfast, good location near the center, clean surrounding, great value for money. I used one bed room, which was exactly what I needed. I warmly recommend this place without any doubt.
We only stayed for one night and everything was fine. Excellent value for money. Free breakfast and free parking.
Coffee at breakfast
Good location, privat parking, nice rooms.
Located not far from the city center, yet in a fairly quiet neighbourhood. Parking free of charge in front of the hotel. Good value for the price.
The staff is very kind, very responsive to all inquiries. Hotel is new and clean, rooms are very cozy and warm. Location is great, less than 10 minutes to center of town with tram (tram station is also very close). We will stay here again!
The location was perfect, just a 2 minutes walk from the Zagreb Main Bus Station. So it was very easy to reach by the shuttle bus from the airport. And also easy to reach any bus to Plitvice/Zadar/Split or any other town. The old town of Zagreb is just 5 stops (10-15 minutes) away by the tram adjacent to the bus station. The hotel is modern and nicely decorated. Staff was great, we got complimentary welcome drinks. Room was big, clean and facilitated with all amenities. Toilet was clean.
Lovely, professional and helpful receptionist (cheers for Dragana), proximity to (main) bus and tram station, cleanliness, comfort.
Very nice, new and modern hotel with a bar and restaurant. Very close to central train and bus station. By walk you can get to city centre where is a lot of nice bars and restaurants or another tourist attractions. The hotel is in peaceful and safe area. I had a nice and clean room with a big window to the garden. I would stay again. :o)
close to the international bus station and the tram station, the quiet part of town ...

Clean and comfort room, very close to the bus station. A good choice if you want to take bus in the very early morning to other place like plitvicka lake.

Nice and comfortable. It is far away from the city center, but fitted to our plans.

Great new hotel that even the locals do not know about. :) Our customer was driving us around, but it seemed a little far away from the city Highlights. So check the distance. Thank you for the welcoming drink :) it was a pleasure.
The room was very tidy and clean and the staff very welcoming and could speak English.
Excellent location easy access to the bus terminal Bonus - welcome drink is rare in hotel in Europe Like the fresh looks and cleanliness of the hotel

The staff and the location.
Had an absolute pleasure of staying at Slisko. Very close to the bus station so it was very easy to travel to and from the hotel. The staff is amazing! Tihomir was very helpful with my luggage which has stuck in Belgrade. The breakfast was HUGE & TASTY. I highly recommend Hotel Slisko for those of you who is looking for a budget solution.
Hotel location is excellent (close to main roads/bus station, 15 min walk from downtown). Hotel bar is nice and staff is very friendly. Breakfast was OK, could have used a bit more variety.
The receprionist was really nice and helpful. The lobby is wonderfully decorated
Staff was super friendly. Located near the ZET which made it easy to get to town. Good value.
Beautiful place, very close to the bus Station and a lot of tram
Clean and cosy room, nice restorant, good food, availability of garage, helpful staff. Hotel is pretty close to down town and many other important locations.
It is clean and good, although it could use some renovating. Location is great.
Great location close to the city centre
Clean, staff is very nice, parking space, breakfast is excellent, although i did have one this time. Quiet place. Good place to stay.
24h reception is a plus when your flight is late: I could check-in in night, having a very good sleeping, an hot shower and ready to go. No frills hotel with spacious rooms, clean (but with moquette in the room) and cheap. Very near to the place I need to be. As a second choice i’ll come back....
3 bed room was spacious, clean and comfortable. Staff was very polite and helpful. I can recommend it for a budget traveler.
Front desk great, very helpful. Very tasty options for breakfast.
Good location and friendly staff. Good and reasonably priced breakfast. Minutes of walk from long distance bus station.
In the old town
Breakfast was well worth it
Modern hotel. Spacious room. Breakfast was ok but basic. Stayed for one night. Quiet neighborhood.Easy acces from the freeway. 20 min walking from city center.
The rooms were very clean, staff was helpful. The afternoon guy at the front desk was very helpful, with any questions that you had.
The hotel is 5' away by walking from the main bus station (where the bus from the airport ends), that's pretty handy. The room was big enough, good air conditioning, good shower and spacey. It has a nice lounge / bar at the lobby which can come handy if you want to enjoy a drink. There is also a supermarket after a 2' walk. Overall staff was very kind. Be aware that this is not a centric location, so you'd most likely have to take the tram to go to the touristy area (5' walk + 10' ride + waiting time). They also changed my sheets without me requesting it, it is always nice to have fresh sheets, as well as seeing the hotel is very well clean and neat
Location. Nearly has a Supermarket
The Manager at the reception was very helpful and guided me on the places to visit and transportation. They also let me relax in the patio after my checkout while I was waiting for my bus. The Hotel is very convenient from the Main Bus terminal.
Closeness to bus terminal. Car garage.
We made a choice according to the proximity to the central bus station, so for us it was perfectly located. Quite nice for a day or two, however cold and basic when it comes to the room design, more of a motel style of a room. Lovely nice lounge and bar.
conveniently located.

This is really decent hotel located in quiet area not too far away from city center. Beds are comfortable, room is clean and staff is polite and helpful.

Location and friendly staff
Good location. The rooms were a good size and well equipped. The bathrooms were clean and tidy. The check-in process was very smooth. We stayed here only for a night but I would recommend this place!
I would say this hotel is absolutely great choice for staying several nights in Zagreb. Breakfast was good, staff is very friendly and give complete information about hotel itself, city, transportation, sights and many other different things you need for comfortable staying. Even though I booked budget category of the room we were given with upper category free of charge due to the fact that hotel was almost empty at that time. One more positive thing is that because of early check-out we could not stay for a breakfast, so this amount was refunded to me by hotel administration without any problems. The location is quite good, right several minutes walk from central bus station, so it was convinient for us to get to shutle-bus going to airport. Just 5 stops on a tram and you will be in the city center walking these beautiful Zagreb's streets.
Comfortable , spacious , Clean and modern

Even though I booked budget category of the room we were given with upper category free of charge due to the fact that hotel was almost empty at that time. One more positive thing is that because of early check-out we could not stay for a breakfast, so this amount was refunded to me by hotel administration without any problems. The location is quite good, right several minutes walk from central bus station, so it was convinient for us to get to shutle-bus going to airport. Just 5 stops on a tram and you will be in the city center walking these beautiful Zagreb's streets.
Comfortable , spacious , Clean and modern
The owner was terriffic...the breakfast the best I have had in a long time...healthy choices.
Everything is really really nice
I stayed in this area in order to catch the shuttle bus from and to the Zagreb airport late at night and then, a day later, early in the morning. The main bus station is an easy 10-minute walk from the hotel (which is about 25-30 minutes from Ban Jelačić Square). The surrounding neighborhood was totally different from the Lower Town area where I stayed the week before, containing new office parks, medical facilities, car repair shops, and some rather old housing. It's interesting. There were a number of decent restaurants (Croatian, Bosnian, Lebanese, Turkish, Chinese) in the vicinity, particularly just around the corner on Radnička cesta, as well as several typical cafes and a really good craft beer bar (the Hop In). My room was fine--clean and entirely serviceable--and I enjoyed the vibe of the place. I don't know the history of the establishment (and it could just have been my imagination), but it reminded me of some of the Eastern European hotels I stayed at during the Cold War, with the heavy, dark wood fixtures/closets in the room, the restaurant with large tables filled with happy and boisterous local families, the traditional decorations, the classic tunes blaring over the sound system. I really liked it!
It is very well located in the city. This means that public transportation is relatively near, but can also be avoided completely as some attractions are in walking distance. Car is not necessary. The property has a modern look with some old-time relics inside.
Mint tee during breakfast.
Staff great, location for what I needed, perfect. I don't usually eat in hotels, but because of heavy snow I did this evening and the evening meal was actually very good! .. and great service.
Great breakfast, good location to explore the city, friendly and helpful personnel,
Good location near the main bus and train stations, friendly reception.
Mostly was good, especially a receptionist man I can't recall his name, but he was if 40+ of age.
i like the breakfast! the staff was accommodating and helped us by giving directions going to city center and back. she also gave us a room upgrade. The room was clean. Definitely value for money.
Location and friendly staff
Good location. The rooms were a good size and well equipped. The bathrooms were clean and tidy. The check-in process was very smooth. We stayed here only for a night but I would recommend this place!

The location is great. Very good breakfast. The rooms are clean. The staff was nice.
Perfect location close to all the sights, very quiet, nice staff, pretty courtyard to have a drink in.
Absolutely everything, this is our second time staying here when coming to Zagreb and we wouldn’t stay anywhere else. Dead center of the main downtown shopping and food area, immaculate rooms, extremely friendly and helpful staff, very good breakfast in a gorgeous courtyard, and incredible value for the money.
The breakfast had a very nice variety, meats, cheeses, fruits, breads, as well at hot foods (eggs, sausage, I don't remember but others as well). My children were made very happy by wide variety of small packages of nutella, honey, jam, etc. Our room was very spacious and very comfortable and the shower was very good. There were coffee and tea facilities in the room. The hotel is close to everything, we walked to old town and many museums easily. We stayed at the hotel twice, on either end of our trip, and so the hotel arranged 4 taxis for us to/from the airport, and every one went off smoothly and on time. And you pay the hotel directly for the taxi and get a better rate.
The location is excellent and the breakfast is top notch.
A small old hotel of character right in the middle of everything. Perfect for sightseeing, eating and 2 minutes from the trams to anywhere. Breakfast good. Also has a terrace for drinks and cakes. Thoroughly recommended.
nice place and location nice rooms friendly staff

Located in very center, almost on the main city square. Parking is free and safe and is located on the walking distance from the hotel. Very polite host will offer you help with the luggage from the car to the hotel room. Our room was very clean and spacious like the whole hotel.
The bed extra comfy and bathroom clean and well equpped.
The location was perfect as it was in the center where all the shops and restaurants are near the hotel and also the price was some what reasonable.
Everything
The hotel completely exceeded our expectations. The furnishings were lovely and original. The beds were amazingly comfortable. The breakfast was lovely, complete with delicious freshly squeezed orange and grapefruit juice. The staff were super accommodating. I had unexpected knee surgery just a couple days prior to our trip, and they tried to help me in any way they could. (They could not change the lack of elevator, but I managed to get up and down the stairs.)
Quaint little hotel in early 1900s style.

The location can't be beat, fantastic!
Excellent location and very helpful and friendly staff
Wonderful breakfast and great central location. The old city was at the top of a flight of stairs out the back of the hotel and the front of the hotel was on the main downtown shopping district We loved the small intimacy of the hotel.
The hotel is in a perfect location right in the centre of town. The staff were lovely and helpful, particularly with the parking, which was a bit complex.

Friendly staff, lovely breakfasts and fantastic location
breakfast was out of this world, perfect location, wonderful staff!
The hotel was in a fantastic location close to the upper town and in walking distances to restaurants and shops and all main sights. The room was very comfy and warm and the bed was very comfy. The room was cleaned every day and there was a good selection for breakfast. I would stay at the Jagerhorn again.
The location was perfect and walking distance to main and top attractions in the city. The staff is helpful and always ready to help. the breakfast was ok and enough for a quick bite before stating the day. The wifi was great and high speed. the room was clean comfortable and relaxing with no noise from outside. its size was perfect and not so small.

Interior was very good. Very Very good location in Zagreb.
loved the rooms, cozy and comfortable inside an old beautiful building and so close to everything.
The hotel is perfectly situated to see the important sights in Zagreb. The staff were always friendly and helpful. Our room was warm and comfortable after long days of sightseeing. The bar was a perfect place for an evening drink. The reception staff had excellent knowledge about the city and answered all of our questions. The breakfast was one of the best we had in our travels. There was so much variety to suit all tastes. Although on a busy shopping street, the hotel is set back (entry is through a courtyard) from any noise.
The location was excellent!
Everything good. Fruit in the breakfast. Good expresso coffee which is essential for a common Portuguese. And this is my third sentence.
The hotel was simply perfect, with one word. It was really 5 minutes walk from the main attractions of the city and also 2-5 minutes walk from the public transfer, and easy to find. The milieu of the hotel is great, the teracces where you can seat in nice wather, the passages and the small hill in the backyards. The equipment and decor is fantastic stylish, we liked it very much. You have really everything what you want. I have to prize the breakfast too, with everything fresh and homemade. (Fresh fruits, fresh and homemade bakery, youghurt, etc.) Staff is also very nice and helpful. I and my colleagues are very glad to find this accomodation.
Staff is great & good service. Room is very nice and comfort with Bathtub. Location is Great!!

The environment,the cleaning, the suite was so beautiful, great breakfast
Very comfortable and big bed, very clean
An excellent choice and a charming hotel with a bit of style located directly in the city centre, with a private parking (free of charge) just 250m from the hotel. Excellent WLAN, friendly staff. I'll be back...
Departed at 0500 and staff generously had a breakfast box prepared for takeaway. Rooms are cozy but everything one needs is there.
I really liked the interior of the hotel and rooms and also the building architecture, it gives a nice retro feel. The location is perfect, as well and you get a free parking near by (in the city center!). It's a very decent hotel. I'd come here again if I have the chance.
The staff is very kind, particularly the person in charge of breakfast and reception

Liked the location. The staff were very helpful booking the car and making suggestions for Resturants.
After traveling for 30 days thru Central Europe we were extremely happy with this charming hotel. One enters thru a courtyard and on the upper level there is a lovely outdoor sitting area surrounded by folliage and a water fountain. The en suite room was equipped with a contemporary enclosed walk in shower that was much better than any other 4 star hotel we stayed at. Then, there is the staff which was by far the most courteous: without us asking, they gave us a boxed breakfast with cappuccino since we were leaving at 6:15 am . They also arranged for taxi service with a flat fee charged to your bill...efficient and stress free!
The hotel staff really helped us out. They helped us with a cab, packed breakfast to go and held our luggage overnight. We felt very well taken care of.
Great location, decent breakfast. Lovely grounds.

The hotel was very nice and clean and on a walk street close to the main restaurant areas of downtown. It also has direct stair access to the old city out the back of the hotel so the location is very good.
Helpful staff, pleasant garden terrace breakfast. Courtyard entrance with cafe. Altogether a quiet oasis in a very busy part of Zagreb.
Very helpful and friendly staff.
The photos on booking.com truly represented the rooms - beds were super comfy, the lighting was intimate, room was very quiet and they had parking! Parking was about an 8 minute walk away - just call for exact directions because it was difficult to find. Someone will come to help with your bags which is very good service. We loved the location of the Jagerhorn - just minutes from the fabulous pedestrian zone of Zagreb where lots of restaurants and shopping can be found. We loved our stay at this hotel - can't imagine staying anywhere else!

Great location, so close to the sites that I connected to the hotel wifi while at the top of the Lotrscak Tower!
We were there for only one night and wanted to maximize our time to tour the old town. This hotel was perfect for that except your taxi needs to drop you off a block away. That was not a problem except the taxi driver did not speak English and could not tell us how to get to the hotel. However, he called the hotel and they sent someone to pick us up. The taxi ride was a whole other story. The hotel offered, and I accepted, their suggested airport shuttle, always preferring to set up a ride beforehand than take a chance with a taxi line at the airport. Our driver met us with a sign outside of baggage and it felt so nice as he carried our luggage to his car. We walked past a line of sleek, black taxis, all spotlessly clean and came up to our taxi which looked like a clown car, every inch covered in ads. It was dirty on the outside as well as inside. From the moment he started the car, he was using either hi iPad or phone. He drove with one hand mostly as the other was either dialing or holding his phone to his ear. He sped and wove in and out of traffic. But worst of all, he didn’t even known where the hotel was located. AND, a first in all my years of travel, he stopped to get gas! And left us in the hot dirty car turned off when he went in to pay! The hotel did not charge us for the ride - and used a different company for the return to the airport the next day. It might have been easier to stay on the outskirts of old town and walk or taxi back in.
Location and bed comfort
Service was excellent. Breakfast in the terrace was very gpod. Location is topnotch.
The facility while only comprised of 18 units offered great amenities, was finished to a very high standard, is in an excellent location and the staff were extremely accommodating.
The hotel is beautiful and in a perfect location
The second floor with no elevator.
Very well situated in the heart of what is interesting,while being quiet at night. Good breakfast. Nice little terrace. Clean. Pleasant personnel.
The hotel was very nice and clean and on a walk street close to the main restaurant areas of downtown. It also has direct stair access to the old city out the back of the hotel so the location is very good.
Breakfast very good. Staff friendly and helpful. Taxi from airport goid value.
Very helpful and friendly staff.
The photos on booking.com truly represented the rooms - beds were super comfy, the lighting was intimate, room was very quiet and they had parking! Parking was about an 8 minute walk away - just call for exact directions because it was difficult to find. Someone will come to help with your bags which is very good service. We loved the location of the Jagerhorn - just minutes from the fabulous pedestrian zone of Zagreb where lots of restaurants and shopping can be found. We loved our stay at this hotel - can't imagine staying anywhere else!
The staff was extremely nice and even packed us a breakfast to go since we had an early morning flight. The room was clean and pleasing. The location was terrific and the hotel sits back from the street so it is quiet.

the little sympathy of breakfast staff
Loved the outside patio area for breakfast and drinks and also the location was excellent. I will stay again.
Nice room and bed, convenient location, and kind staffs. Breakfast was also good.
Very helpful staff. Location very central for the old town and most museums etc. The hotel's position set back from the main road meant it was pretty quiet. Reasonable choice for breakfast served in a pleasant courtyard and there is a comfortable bar area.
This hotel is a hidden jewel. We go back every year, are English spleaking and feel at home at Jagerhorn.
In a great position in old Zagreb with pleasant backdrop above the rear courtyard. Good breakfast with nice outlook particularly when the weather is nice enough to sit outside. Right on main tram routes if you want to explore a little. Make sure you validate your tickets.
We loved everything about this hotel. Great breakfast, great service, spacious room and great location.
Location and friendry staff members.
the location of the hotel is comfortable for both departing from Zagreb by plane or to go from there to the city by car

The hotel is modern, room was enough, bathroom was clean Breakfast was very good with big choice of food and good coffee. Bus stop close to the hotel. Often buses to the centre.
Soundproofing excellent, breakfast very good, cleanliness very good, polite staff
Close to Zagreb airport, perfect for overnight stopover
Liked the airport shuttle from the hotel Very reasonably priced. Same facility should be there from the airport to the hotel.
Convenience to the airport. We like the fact that the breakfast is included. No need to run around and look for breakfast before the flight.
Price performance ratio at its best.
Nice breakfast, nice rooms
The place was located very close to the airport for an early flight and the taxi /shuttle service was reliable to get to the airport on time. Further, even though the hotel is removed from Zagreb (about 20 minutes), it wasn't expensive to get a taxi to the city centre (about $CAD10-15). The bed was comfortable, the staff were extremely helpful and welcoming, and the breakfast was great!
My fifth visit to Best Western Stella. Staff excellent. Breakfast very good. Overall a very very good Hotel. Strongly recommended

6 min drive to airport to drop off rental car
The staff are outstanding and helpfull. Location . Breakfast are also perfect.
It was close to the airport. It was a newer hotel which had parking. They had a shuttle that would take u to the airport for a much cheaper rate than a taxi.
fitness and sauna and breakfast.It seems like a very new hotel and staff did not seem to be well versed in booking procedures on the computer and probably just experiencing teething problems getting used to it.
Very nice hotel. Not as close to the airport as I expected, but there was a shuttle in the morning so that turned out not to be a problem. They even made breakfast early for us so we could catch our plane.
Nice hotel for a short stay. Whenever we pass by Zagreb we always choose Hotel Sttela :)

Electric car charger Good breakfast 24 hour reception Quiet rooms Close to the motorway which was good for us since we were travelling to the coast.
Friendly staff Possibility to have a cheap and qualitative transfer to the airport
CLOSE TO AIR PORT IF YOU COMING LATE ..GRET PLACE
Super clean bathrooms, good cooling, comfy beds. An ironing board was delivered quickly on request. The morning breakfast was quite good, and the airport shuttle at 25Kn per head was excellent.
Clean room, nice staff, good breakfast. It is easy to get on to the highway
Breakfast was good, location to the airport was key for us. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Beds were pretty comfrotable. Rooms are a good size.
This hotel is built for transit travellers. It is located very close to a motorway exit, but far from city center. A taxi ride to the center is around 100Kn ($15), each way. However, for an overnight stay, it is perfect. Nice staff, a very correct and well maintained three star, good, generous breakfast.

Slightly confusing requirements for bedding but easily worked out with the staff. Just to note, there are only 2 family rooms in this establishment so book early if a bigger room is required
Staff were very friendly, food was great, and location was good.
Very clise to the airport. Nice and comfort room
Awesome breakfast! We also like that the hotel is close to highway. When we return to Zagreb we will stay here.

Staff with good service mind and good system of the hotel to service and satisfied customer .

We stayed here to be close to the airport as we had an early flight. The hotel was clean, breakfast was good and it was only a short 15 minute ride to the airport with their shuttle. There are a few restaurants within walking distance. We took a bus into Zagreb to see the sights rather than try to find parking on the narrow streets. It stopped within a few blocks of the hotel and the staff gave us directions.
Highly recommend. Clean,cosy, great staff, great breakfast! They even sent me a drawing my son forgot in the room, it was made for Mother's day :-) :-)
The receptionist was excellent. Helped with a car rental, where we didn’t have to leave the hotel. Forgot his name, but he checked us out that morning. Great job!
The staff are extra friendly and very accomodating. My daughter booked this . I wanted one in the city . When I arrived, I wanted to cancelled and get a hotel in the city . The front desk person assured me it is near the city . The bus stop is walking distance and was about to walk me over . He gave me the directions a.msp and where to go and it was a wonderful 2 days I spent . Breakfast is pretty good with fruits and for a small hotel with plenty of choices. It is a fairly new hotel.and for the price it is excellent service . Iwill b recommend it to my friends. You cannot beat the 4 Kuna for the bus ride and it is 20 minutes away from the airport with a shuttle car for 45 kuna.
The staff were professional and informative. When asked about transportation or restaurants they gave me the information I needed. I would definitely stay again.
Vera Clean nice new rooms
Beds comfortable. Breakfast was amazing!
It is not in the city, but the bus ride is very short and inexpensive.

Bus to Zagreb tourist area stops right in front of hotel. Inexpensive bus rate. Staff was extremely helpful and knowledgeable on the area. Nice breakfast. Full bar. Easy parking on property. Easy trip to airport.
Friendly, efficient and very accomodating. The front desk staff was welcoming and patient with us after a long and exhausting trip. In the morning during breakfast, agian the staff was very accommodating. We travelled with a toddler and a baby and they were most helpful. It was just a short car ride to the hotel. I would stay here again and recommend to friends
The check in and out process was very easy. The young gentleman on the front desk was very pleasant and helpful and was forthcoming with information he is a very good ambassador for this hotel and Croatia. Rooms are very clean with a large bathroom and shower area. Breakfast was a good standard. 10 minute drive to airport.
Staff was helpful from arrival throughout clean , even though 3 star hotel , I have given 5 location closed to motorway, navigation taken us unrelated location advice to use mobile map

The girl at the reception in the hotel in the evenings was perfect. Thank her for her help and attention to all my requests!
Good breakfast good room and friendly staff
Breakfast was good, service was good and good location for what we needed
All expectations were met
This was our third time staying at Rebro over the course of our 6 week overseas trip. The Hotel staff were helpful, including in allowing us to leave unneeded items between our stays. Although a little out of town, you can easy and cheaply get a taxi or the tram (about a 500 metre walk from the Hotel) into the city. The staff were also very fair, it is the only time we have been refunded money, apparently because for our final last two night stay we paid more than was needed with our online booking.
- Clean, nice hotel; - Comfortable beds; - Good buffet breakfast; - Free parking in the hotel's courtyard; - Quiet room and area; - Nice view over the city.
Very good hotel, spacious rooms, very clean. Very friendly & helpful stuff, quiet a good breakfast. Good value for money
This hotel is a little out of town but the friendly staff, who go out of their way to be helpful, and good service makes up for the bit of extra travel.
Top friendly personnel, nice beds and clean rooms
Staff was friendly and the view from my room was fantastic
We were very pleased to find the hotel staff helpful about offering the use of tools to reassemble our bikes and to find we could safely store our bike boxes at the hotel to reuse for our return journey.
Everything
Like the big rooms and avelable parking at the hotel.
the receptionist was very friendly to our late arrival. parking all found and included in the price. room, beds and bathroom absolutely clean. body products available. clean towels. calm at night. and very nice view of the rooftops of Zagreb. Breakfast very good. we recommend it eyes closed.

The hotel is situated in a nice part of Zagreb with beautiful Maksimir Park and the Zoo and cafe/restaurant area within walking distance.
We are very satisfied!! The hotel is located close to the park Maksimir and the zoo and 15 min from the center. The room was spacious and clean. The staff was very polite! The breakfast was varied and delicious! Special thanks to the receptionists who were very very kind with us! I recommend this hotel and we are definitely coming back!
Into the room was very cold from the window.

All the 'amenities' in the room are first class, my view from the second floor was good and I particularly liked the shower which surprised me with its instant control of temperature and its strength flow.
The beds are very comfortable

Staff was very kind and room was clean too. It's a good place to stay if you needed going to hospital
The staff were extremely helpful specifically booking in and out were carried out with the minimum of fuss. There was a large group arriving at the same time as myself who were speedily processed. The room itself was spacious and well set out, bathroom facilities were first class.
The hotel has just a few parking places (free), so it is not sure that you will have enough space. In the garage they have lot of space but it is not free (3 HRK per hour).
Room is comfortable,staf very kind.. Value for money 10!
Everything was good, room clean, tasty bfast, internet worked fine. Perfect for btrip
Very clean, nice and welcoming. Staff was great and helpful. Will stay again when in Zagreb.

Perfect stay for weekend trip :)
Good things: excellent breakfast, several good neighbourhood restaurants nearby, tram station right outside the door.
Nice hotel. Good price.
The hotel was excellent value for the money. The breakfast was delicious, and a nice choice of food.
Nice staff especially night shift front desk lady and bar man, breakfast is included with an affordable price.
The style / each room was homage to one movie actor. We were in the Jack Nicholson room. The reception was in the Movie Pub, very cool place in Zagreb. The staff. Three very kind ladies on the reception desk. The breakfast.
The rooms were nicely decorated with actors photographs. The staff was kind and helpful. The breakfast was OK.
The staff were helpful with regards to tram connections and I slept like a log. The shower was nice and hot.
Helpful staff, great location for passing through
staff was great, the lady at the reception was extremely service oriented and found me free of charge parking spot. all of the staff were great.
Good breakfast and location also ok
Comfortable bed. For 1 night, it is ok, and I could park my car (beware it is not a secured parking, but area did not feel unsafe). Friendly staff.
The place was easy to find by car. There is a tramway to the city centre. It`s ok for a overnight stay. Good value for money.
No parking at property.
Very clean rooms with 3 separated beds
Simplicity, location (according to what I need).
The room was clean and comfortable. Staff was polite. Simple breakfast was included in the price of the room.
Hotel location
Good value for money
Very Good for Single - Air Condition is OK..., Directly at Tram Stop, but not directly Tram to Avtobusni Kolodvor (Bus station).
There’s a tram station in front of the hotel (direction city) or close (from city), tram 14 and 17, night bus 32 to and from centre 15 to 17 min. The room was clean. Shower was warm and clean. Internet connection with Wifi/WLAN was good. The rooms are decorated with movie stars. Breakfast was okay, but nothing special.
Staff is very friendly. Breakfast is ok. Location is good.
Hotel has a very interesting idea of each door has a different movie star. it suits me perfectly. It is not in a busy part of town and even with the bar in the ground floor and staying in the first floor I haven't heard any noise. The room is basic but I was expecting it, bathroom was also very basic but once again, it was expected. There is a TV in the room and one table. Overall stay was good.

Room was spacious. Location was good. Reception staff was very friendly whenever I came up with questions. The hotel has a nice character, which I liked. Bar looked good too. Breakfast was ok. Parking at the backyard available too (open air, not secured!)
Breakfast
This hotel have a soul
Friendly personnel in a hotel with an unusual but interesting decoration (Movie based.) There is a Pub (the Movie Pub) associated with the hotel.
The location is very close to the tram stops. There is a pub on the ground floor for the food and dining. Live music during the weekends. Breakfast is better than the continental breakfast. Texas Grill brings in the breakfast into the pub in morning.
Just on the road, location is good.
1. The staff was good 2. The theme is excellent
After I had very bad experience with Swansky hotel where they asked my passport or credit card to keep at reception during my stay,, I decided to pick MOVIE HOTEL. I booked at 13:00 and at 14:00 already settled in. I really liked the thematic of the of the hotel, personal (a bit small but ok) rooms, restaurant and breakfast that was included. I checked in easy and very fast and I have a very good experience with MOVIE hotel. Thank you

Heating was super low, the entire room was cold. You have to wait for warm water for ages. No Internet connection to be seen anywhere on the a list. Come on this is the 21st century. Mottled shieldbugs everywhere in bed which made it super disgusting. That was the reason for checking out around midnight and getting another hotel. Payed this, was not asked by staff is everything okay, they were causally drinking beer at the reception. I don't not reccomend this to your dogs, let alone yourself.
Very clean and comfortable. People working there are kind and always smiling.
Idea. Movie themed hotel seems like a cool idea. There are plenty of food options you can select from. There is absolutely nothing more I can write positvely about that place.
The movie bar
Breakfast was quite terrible. It was served in a "pub" that had a smell of a pub as well. In the description was said that there is a parking available, however it turned out that parking is available for 2 cars in front of the hotel on the street litterally next to tram stop.
Bar was nicely decorated as a British pub and extremely dark.
There is nothing postive except good location.
The room is spacious and clean, the bed is comfortable.
Nothing works in room fridge. T.v. No toiletries. Bar or restaurant not operating.
Good bed& bedlinen, interesting decor, excellent breakfast. The location was convenient for our business purposes. The hotel was easy to find. We loved The Movie Pub downstairs.

The movie bar
very dirty place. full of ants and powder.
AC, fridge, wi-fi not working. We booked a queen size bed plus a single and we got 3 single beds.
Good bed& bedlinen, interesting decor, excellent breakfast. The location was convenient for our business purposes. The hotel was easy to find. We loved The Movie Pub downstairs.
There was absolutely Nothing to like about this Run Down excuse for a Hotel. It is literally falling apart in front of your eyes. It should`nt even have a licence to allow members of the public to enter.
Staff really nice and helpful nice theme elevator
Too old, too much noise from the street, too much noise from the ancient air condition, it was a really hot day and it was impossible for us to stay so we asked for our money back and left.
24 hour Check In.
I reserved a double room and a triple room and we received 2 single and one triple rooms, telling us that it is a misunderstanding from booking. But we received the confirmation of booking the 2 rooms.

The place is very cozy. Nice staff. And a good restaurant downstairs.
Clean, comfortable, well positioned, fast internet, delicious breakfast, and very kind service. Excellent hotel with a unique bar.
We like this lokation. We like this other way of living there, sort of siplicyty, of common man life... Room.
First of all, focus on the positive! :) If you are looking for a 4*/5* hotel with Spa, don't come here. But, if you are looking for a casual place, with a character and charm, moderate price, superb service, good BBQ dining, coasy Pub - this is the place for you. 1.) Customer orientaded service: the staff performance is superb - from the first contact untill I left the service was on the highest level (at the reception, Pub and restaurant); I would like especially to appraise charming young lady at the reception Ivana who had the atmost patience with providing all the necessary informations regarding the stay and who does all in her power to make the guest feel wellcome. 2.) Food: if you are a meet/BBQ loving person (like me) you will love the food here. Breakfast is also very good (variety of the breakfast food could be better, but the quality is very good); missing some fruit, vegetables and musli maybe :) 3.) The Movie Pub: nice pub with character with photos of Hollywood movie stars. Very coasy and pleasant place. 4.) Location: excellent location on Savska street - tram stop is in front of the Hotel (15 min to the Zagreb main square by tram) 5.) The price: modest price fully worth it. 6.) Wi-Fi: in the Pub superb (30/30 Mbps), but in the rooms not so much. Tip: book a half or full bord stay - it is absolutely worth it.
Good Breakfast, great location!
very old property, elevator and room entrance are very bad
Its really good and different Each room is named after different Actor/Actress
Poor wifi signal
Staff was very kind, friendly and helpful. Location was good, about 10/15 minutes from city center by tram.

We couldn't close the window (room nr.15) all the way since ti was missing a hook. I've managed to provisionaly close the window by using the coat hanger. The street view is a disaster, very noisy from all of the cars and streetcar, also loud music till 4am from the caffe just next from the hotel was horrible.
